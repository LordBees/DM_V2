[BG1],I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong,I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me,I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds,The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.,,

[BG4],When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money,I have a “tell” that reveals when I’m lying,I turn tail and run when things look bad.,If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll ignore it.
