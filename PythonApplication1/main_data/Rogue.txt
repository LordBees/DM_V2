[BG1],I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong,I am always calm. no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me,I dont pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds,The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.,,
[BG2],Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken. as are those who would forge them.,People. I am loyal to my friends. not to any ideals. everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care.,Redemption. There is a spark of good in everyone.,Honor. I do not steal from others in the trade.,,
[BG3],I am trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.,I am guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it,My ill-gotten gains go to support my family,Something important was taken from me. I aim to steal it back.,,
[BG4],When faced with a choice between money and my friends. I usually choose the money,I have a *tell* that reveals when I am lying,I turn tail and run when things look bad.,If there is a plan. I will forget it. If I dont forget it. I will ignore it...,,
